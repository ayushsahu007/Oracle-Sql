top 5 company based on higst number of employee 
select c_name from(select c_name,count(*) from company group by c_name

This query assigns a unique row number to each employee based on their salary in descending order, partitioned by department.

select sal from (select ename,sal,deptno,row_number()over(partition by deptno order by sal desc)r from emp) where r = 2;

This query calculates the average salary by department and returns employees who earn above the average salary of their respective departments.

select avg(sal),deptno from emp group by deptno;

This query finds employees who earn more than the average salary of their department.
select sal,deptno from emp where sal > (select avg(sal) from emp e);

This query finds the highest salary and the number of employees in each department.

select d.dname,e.deptno,count(e.empno),MAX(e.SAL) from emp e inner join dept d on  e.deptno = d.deptno group by d.dname,e.deptno; 

Query: Find pairs of employees in the same department who earn more than each other.
